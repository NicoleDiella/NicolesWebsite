                HELLO! My name is Nicole, and this is my first time ever making a website from 
                scratch and actually coding. A few things that I really love to do nowadays is 
                playing games all day long, especially CS:GO a.k.a Counter Strike Global Offensive.
                </ol>
                <ol>
                Ever since I was a only a small clueless child, I have always loved putting makup on.
                I would watch so many beauty Youtubers and follow their tutorials. When I grew older,
                I started exploring more on the beauty community and discovered how to style my hair, 
                and do my nails. 
                </ol>
                <ol>
                I started doing my nails and makeup when I was around 5, and have always stuck to it
                ever since. I'm 14 and it has almost been a decade of experimenting and ressearchng new
                beauty tricks.
                </ol>
                <ol>
                About 2 years ago, I have started learning how to do my hair and finally held and used my
                curling rod for the first time by myself. As for my nails, it is safe to say that
                I am able to make <a href = "nails.html">nail art </a> myself.
                </ol>
                <ol> 
                When I was in grade 7, I started learning more about skin care and found passion in 
                maintaining a healthy skincare routine.I have watched a lot of skin care videos, 
                especially the K-Beauty ones, because I love the way Korean people's skin look.    
                </ol>
                <ol>
                Currently, I am a BTS ARMY (clearly) and I love their music very much. I honestly look
                up to them because I think that they are so inspirational because od their hardwork and 
                fight agaisnt so much hate and prejudice thoughout the years that they have debuted.
                I wish I have gotten to know them earlier so that I could enjou more moments with them.
                </ol>
                <ol>
                I also love travelling amd exploring different places of the world. I have to say i'm 
                quite a sporty girl, and I especially love snorkeling. Here are some 
                <a href = "travel.html"> picurtes </a> of my travels!
